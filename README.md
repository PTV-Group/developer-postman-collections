# developer-postman-collections
For some PTV Developer APIs we provide specific Postman collections. 
The collections are modeled after CodeSamples from [PTV Developer](https://developer.myptv.com).
The included sample requests are easy to modify according to your needs. 
The result of some requests of these collections will be visualized e.g. a route or reachable area is displayed on a map or the optimized bins are arranged on a loading space.
Find out how to use these collections and how to create your own in this [tutorial](https://developer.myptv.com/Tutorials/General/postman.htm).

Please note that the collections are not updated with every API release.
